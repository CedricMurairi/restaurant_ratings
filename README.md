# Visualizing Restaurant Reviews

This project uses a [Voronoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) diagram to visualize ratings for restaurants in Berkeley using machine learning. It uses the k-means algorithm to cluster restaurants and the least squares regression to predict what rating a user would give a restaurant given the user's previous reviews. This [project](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a/fa17/proj/maps/) is taken from UC Berkeley's CS61A course.
